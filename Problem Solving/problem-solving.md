## Problem Solving

- A very important skill for software engineers
- Can be improved with practice

#### How to improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Steps to solve a problem

#### 1. Understand the problem

Before you start solving a problem, you need to understand the problem. You can ask yourself the following questions:

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data?

#### 2. Explore concrete examples

It's always a good idea to come up with some examples to understand the problem better. You can ask yourself the following questions:

- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explore examples with invalid inputs
- Explore examples with large inputs
- Explore examples with edge cases

#### 3. Break it down

Break the problem into smaller pieces. You can ask yourself the following questions:

- Write down the steps you need to take
- Write down the pseudocode
- Write down the code
- Refactor the code
- Test the code

#### 4. Solve/Simplify

If you can't solve the problem, solve a simpler problem. Basically, if you get stuck on some part of the problem, try to solve what you can and then go back to the part you got stuck on. You can ask yourself the following questions:

- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

#### 5. Look back and refactor

After you solve the problem, look back and see if you can refactor the code. You can ask yourself the following questions:

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem?
